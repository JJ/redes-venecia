                    <h2>JJ Merelo (UGR-ES)</h2>
                    <h3>Wivace, 2023</h3>
		    <aside class='notes'>Ca' d'Oro was built by the Contarini family, one of the longest-living families in Venice, which gave 7 doges to the republic, and had many palaces built all over Venice. When you look at the social network of marriages in the republic, this family has a high degree of self-loops, marriages between different members of the family.</aside>

		<section data-background='https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52003007730_0422c4ae7a_k_d.jpg'><h1>Let me tell you about the Contarinis</h1>
		  <aside class='notes'>This is the palace Contarini degli Scrigni e Corfù; they are a single complex, the Corfù palace is on the right, the other on the left. It's a palace complex belonging to one of the branches of the family, called "degli Scrigni", or "the chests", as in "treasure chests". The Scrigni palace is the work of Scamozzi, one of the most important architects after Palladio and Longhena. He proposed architecture as a complex science, more than an art. Look at the number of windows: hexafora in Ca d'Oro, tetrafora (four windows) here. This was proportional to the size of the big halls: these guys were rich. And abundant.</aside>

		  <h2 class='fragment'>We don't know: most measurements drop them, or are not affected by them.</h2>

		  <aside class='notes'>Clearly, there is some correlation: big family size, rich family implies both centrality and intra-family marriages. But there might not be a direct relationship, and we are anyway usually dropping these pieces of data</aside>
