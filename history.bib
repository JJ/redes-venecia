    abstract = "{It has been claimed and disputed that World War II has been followed by a ‘long peace’: an unprecedented decline of war. We conduct a full change point analysis of well-documented, publicly available battle deaths data sets, using new techniques that enable the robust detection of changes in the statistical properties of such heavy-tailed data. We first test and calibrate these techniques. We then demonstrate the existence of changes, independent of data presentation, in the early to mid-19th century, as the Congress of Vienna system moved towards its collapse, in the early to mid-20th century, bracketing the World Wars, and in the late 20th century, as the world reconfigured around the end of the Cold War. Our analysis provides a methodology for future investigations and an empirical basis for political and historical discussions.}",

ABSTRACT = {During most of the lifespan of the Venetian republic, doges (the name their presidents received) were elected for life. However, a long tenure was a rare event, which effectively resulted in term limits, as has already been reported by several authors. In this paper, we examine the length of these tenures and their evolution during the existence of the Venetian republic, following Smith et al.&rsquo;s claim that specific events in Venetian history caused this shortening, but also the dates and possibly event or events that effectively caused that limitation by design. Finally, we will discuss the causes of this limitation and its effective consequences.},

title = {A Novel Technique for Long-Term Anomaly Detection in the Cloud},
year = {2014},
publisher = {USENIX Association},
address = {USA},
abstract = {High availability and performance of a web service is key, amongst other factors, to the overall user experience (which in turn directly impacts the bottom-line). Exogenic and/or endogenic factors often give rise to anomalies that make maintaining high availability and delivering high performance very challenging. Although there exists a large body of prior research in anomaly detection, existing techniques are not suitable for detecting long-term anomalies owing to a predominant underlying trend component in the time series data.To this end, we developed a novel statistical technique to automatically detect long-term anomalies in cloud data. Specifically, the technique employs statistical learning to detect anomalies in both application as well as system metrics. Further, the technique uses robust statistical metrics, viz., median, and median absolute deviation (MAD), and piecewise approximation of the underlying long-term trend to accurately detect anomalies even in the presence of intra-day and/or weekly seasonality. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique using production data and report Precision, Recall, and F-measure measure. Multiple teams at Twitter are currently using the proposed technique on a daily basis.},
