		  <h2 class='fragment'>Always strived for independence, but also rule of law</h2>
		  <h3 class='fragment'>Doges were servants of the republic</h3>
		  <aside class='notes'>The classical view of the doge shows him kneeling in front of the Virgin, as well as Saint Mark, here represented with a feather and a lion; sometimes it's just a lion. The attitude is always that of a servant; from early on the attempts to concentrate power by the doge were thwarted, and the whole legislative system was built around that intention.</aside>

		    <aside class='notes'>The battle of Lepanto by Veronese, here, marks more or less the end of that period of the Republic: Venice never recovered from the loss of Cyprus, and it started to focus on industrial production and agriculture in Terraferma more than commerce.</aside>

		    <aside class='notes'>Squares are all over the network, showing that most doges were in families that fell in the main component of the network, and the ones that had the highest number of doges were the most central. Besides, red families are still there, the "aristocratic" party, while "popular" families have almost completely disappeared. Still, it's a small world, non-power-law network, that avoids dominance by a single family.</aside>
