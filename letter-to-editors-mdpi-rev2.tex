\section*{Response to the reviewers}

We would like to thank the reviewer for the attention that our work has
received, and their very detailed review. We will address their concerns next

\reviewersection

\subsection{Major points and suggestions}

\begin{point}
  Consequently, would it not be better to change the title into: Finding turning points in the time series of noble marriages during the time of the Republic of Venice? or: Detecting turning points by using multi-change point analysis of noble marriages during the time of the Republic of Venice? A new title would clear the table from any expectation to see a slow social phenomenon explaining, or explained by, an event which is a particular point in time that may or may not be the principal trigger for the slow social phenomenon.
\end{point}

\begin{reply}
  We have changed the title to {\em Detecting pivotal moments by using change point analysis of noble marriages during the time of the Republic of Venice}. Since we use single- and multi- change point analysis, we thought it was better to not refer to just one of the techniques used. On the other hand, we think it is important that we arrive at history from statistics, so we have changed {\em turning points} to {\em pivotal moments}, which also avoids repetition of the word {\em points} in the title.
\end{reply}

\subsection{Minor points}

\begin{point}
  p. 1, lines 32-36 – the doge is not the President of the republic. His rank is Prince, but he is also “first among equals”. I would reformulate as follows: “its state was governed by a representative figure, with a rank of prince, called doge, elected for life, initially by popular acclamation, then from the 12th century by all male nobles, members of the Great Council, the sovereign body of the Republic Maranini (1927); Ruggiero (1979)”.
	\label{pt:m:1}
      \end{point}

      \begin{reply}
Fixed as suggested. Thanks for the suggestion.
\end{reply}

\begin{point}
   p. 2, lines 81-82: “and then showed that the time spent in doges decreased
   extensively after that date”. I suppose the Author means: “…that the time
   doges remained in office decreased….”
   	\label{pt:m:2}
 \end{point}

 \begin{reply}
   Done as suggested. Thanks again.
 \end{reply}

\begin{point}
p. 4, figure 1 – “blue shows marriages within the same family” – I think the Author should explain that the extended family has a number of branches (sometimes 2-3, some others up to 30 or even more). When one branch has only a female member, the usual custom is to get her married to a male from a close branch in order not to lose the heritage, nor the potential votes of family members. It might be wise to explain this somewhere in the article.
   	\label{pt:m:3}
 \end{point}

 \begin{reply}
   This was a caption to a Figure. It has been extended and explained further in
   the text, citing Raines 2013. The mention to why some of those marriages took
   place when a there was a single female in the {\em ramo} was probably out of
   scope for the paper, and I could not find a precise source for it, so I left
   it out.
 \end{reply}

 \begin{point}
p. 6 lines 183-185 – “Taking into account that marriage can be considered a market Becker (1973), it is quite clear that the number of marriages will depend on the supply of available (noble) males” – I would suggest looking also at Munno, Derosas (2015) for the Venetian noble marriage market and its strategies.
   	\label{pt:m:4}
 \end{point}

 \begin{reply}
That reference has been included in the bibliography and cited right behihd
Becker. It certainly is a good presentation of the marriage market, focused on
the last years of the Republic.
