\section*{Response to the reviewers}

We would like to thank the reviewer for the attention that our work has
received, and their very detailed review. We will address their concerns next

\subsection{Minor points}

\begin{point}
  p. 1, lines 32-36 – the doge is not the President of the republic. His rank is Prince, but he is also “first among equals”. I would reformulate as follows: “its state was governed by a representative figure, with a rank of prince, called doge, elected for life, initially by popular acclamation, then from the 12th century by all male nobles, members of the Great Council, the sovereign body of the Republic Maranini (1927); Ruggiero (1979)”.
	\label{pt:m:1}
      \end{point}

      \begin{reply}
Fixed as suggested. Thanks for the suggestion.
\end{reply}

\begin{point}
   p. 2, lines 81-82: “and then showed that the time spent in doges decreased
   extensively after that date”. I suppose the Author means: “…that the time
   doges remained in office decreased….”
   	\label{pt:m:2}
 \end{point}

 \begin{reply}
   Done as suggested. Thanks again.
 \end{reply}
